config CAVS_IPC
	bool
	default y if !SOF
	help
	  Driver for the host IPC interrupt delivery mechanism.
	  Currently SOF has its own driver for this hardware.

config CAVS_CLOCK
	bool
	help
	  Driver for the CAVS clocks. Allow type of clock (and
	  thus frequency) to be chosen.

config HP_SRAM_RESERVE
	int "Bytes to reserve at start of HP-SRAM"
	default 65536
	help
	  Bytes to reserve at the start of HP-SRAM.  Zephyr will not
	  place any symbols here, though the host windows have
	  addresses here.  The SOF application also makes direct use
	  of this region, so be very careful changing this value.

config ADSP_WIN0_OFFSET
	int "Byte offset of host window zero"
	default 16384
	help
	  Offset of the first host shared memory window (used for the
	  "firmware status register" at boot) within the reserved
	  region at the start of HP-SRAM.

config ADSP_WIN2_OFFSET
	int "Byte offset of host window two"
	default 32768
	help
	  Offset of the second host shared memory window within
	  the reserved region at the start of HP-SRAM.
	  Typically used for debug output, but semantics can vary
	  depending on the host-firmware communication scheme that
	  is used.

config ADSP_WIN3_OFFSET
	int "Byte offset of host window three"
	default 40960
	help
	  Offset of the second host shared memory window within
	  the reserved region at the start of HP-SRAM.
	  Typically used for debug output, but semantics can vary
	  depending on the host-firmware communication scheme that
	  is used.

config ADSP_TRACE_SIMCALL
	bool "Emit SIMCALL output in addition to window tracing"
	help
	  When true, the trace_out layer will also use a SIMCALL
	  instruction to emit the passed data to the standard output
	  of an enclosing simulator process.  All window contents will
	  remain identical.
