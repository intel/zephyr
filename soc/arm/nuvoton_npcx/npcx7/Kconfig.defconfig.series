config SOC_SERIES
	default "npcx7"

config NUM_IRQS
	default 64

config CORTEX_M_SYSTICK
	default !NPCX_ITIM_TIMER
	help
	  Disable Cortex-M system tick if NPCX_ITIM_TIMER is enabled.

config CLOCK_CONTROL_NPCX
	default y
	depends on CLOCK_CONTROL
	help
	  Enable support for NPCX clock controller driver.

config UART_NPCX
	default y
	depends on SERIAL
	help
	  Enable support for NPCX UART driver.

config GPIO_NPCX
	default y
	depends on GPIO
	help
	  Enable support for NPCX GPIO driver.

config PWM_NPCX
	default y
	depends on PWM
	help
	  Enable support for NPCX PWM driver.

config ADC_NPCX
	default y
	depends on ADC
	help
	  Enable support for NPCX ADC driver. In NPCX7 series, it includes a
	  10-bit resolution Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Up to 10 voltage
	  inputs can be measured and a internal voltage reference (VREF), 2.816V
	  (typical) is used for measurement.

config WDT_NPCX
	default y
	depends on WATCHDOG
	help
	  Enable support for NPCX Watchdog driver. Besides watchdog
	  functionality, it also provides the protection mechanism over software
	  execution. After setting the configuration registers, the software can
	  lock it to provide a higher level of protection against subsequent
	  erroneous software action. Once a section of the TWD is locked, only
	  reset or the unlock sequence releases it.

config ESPI_NPCX
	default y
	depends on ESPI
	help
	  Enable support for NPCX ESPI driver. The Intel Enhanced Serial
	  Peripheral Interface (eSPI) provides a path for migrating host
	  sub-devices via LPC to a lower pin count, higher bandwidth bus.
	  So far, this driver supports all of functionalities beside flash
	  channel support. It will be supported in the future. Please refer
	  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000020952/
	  software/chipset-software.html for more detail.

config I2C_NPCX
	default y
	depends on I2C
	help
	  Enable support for NPCX I2C driver. The NPCX SMB/I2C modules provides
	  full support for a two-wire SMBus/I2C synchronous serial interface.
	  Each interface is a two-wire serial interface that is compatible with
	  both Intel SMBus and Philips I2C physical layer. There are 8 SMBus
	  modules and 10 buses in NPCX7 series.

config TACH_NPCX
	default y
	depends on SENSOR
	help
	  Enable support for NPCX tachometer sensor driver. The NPCX7 series
	  contains two tachometer (TACH) modules that contains two counters
	  (counter A and B). They are used to capture/compare a counter value
	  when an event is generated on comparison of signals match.

if SOC_POWER_MANAGEMENT

config PM
	default y if SYS_CLOCK_EXISTS
	help
	  Enable the kernel handles extra power management policies whenever
	  system enters idle state.

config PM_DEVICE
	default y
	help
	  Enable device power management support.

config SPI_NPCX_FIU
	default y
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Enable support fot NPCX SPI (FIU) driver for the NOR SPI flash access.
