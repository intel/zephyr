  Generic pin configuration schema.

  This file is equivalent to pincfg-node.yaml but inserts properties at a
  grandchildren level, useful for group based representation.

    description: |
      Many data items that are represented in a pin configuration node are
      common and generic. Pin control bindings should use the properties
      defined below where they are applicable; not all of these properties are
      relevant or useful for all hardware or binding structures. Each
      individual binding document should state which of these generic
      properties, if any, are used, and the structure of the DT nodes that
      contain these properties.

      This is based on Linux, documentation:
        https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pincfg-node.yaml
